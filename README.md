# VivaCubeSolver

## Application capable of solving the magic cube from images captured by the camera.

project not yet complete.<br />

## How to use.

Although I have put the option to turn on the flashlight, this glare caused by it can compromise reading. I recommend using it where there is good lighting.<br />

First click on the open camera button. Place each face of the cube on the grid that appears on the screen and take a picture.<br />

When you have all 6 cube images. Go back to the main menu and choose solve images. A text with the message "Loading..." will appear, click on it and wait for the next information.<br />

If all goes well you will see the scramble on the screen. If you click on the scamble it will take you to the animation screen, flip the cube so that U is on top and F is facing you, just follow the instructions until you complete the magic cube.<br />
